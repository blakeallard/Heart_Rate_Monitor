# Heart Rate Monitor & Health Classifier

This project demonstrates a real-time heart rate monitoring system that uses an Arduino microcontroller and Python to analyze ECG data and classify health states (resting vs. active).

## Overview

The system collects heart rate data using an Arduino, processes it with Python, visualizes the results, and applies machine learning for basic classification.

## Getting Started

1.  **Hardware:** You'll need an Arduino board and an ECG sensor.
2.  **Software:** Install Python 3 and libraries like NumPy, SciPy, Scikit-learn, and Matplotlib.
3.  **Run the Script:** Execute `python heart_rate_analysis.py` to see the system in action!

## Code Highlights

*   **Arduino (`HeartRateMonitor.ino`):** Reads ECG data from a sensor.
*   **Python (`heart_rate_analysis.py`):** Processes data, creates visualizations, and performs classification.
